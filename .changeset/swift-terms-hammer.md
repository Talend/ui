'@talend/bootstrap-theme': major
---

Use @talend/design-tokens for all colors

This is considered as a BREAKING CHANGE.

To be aligned with this theme you should:

* replace all hardcoded colors used in your project and use `@talend/design-tokens`
* test your application with the dark theme

We have updated the following bootstrap styles:
* Button
* Table
* Form (control)
* Navbar
* Modal
* Tooltip
* Popover
* Alert
* Badge
* Breadcrumb
* Tabs
* Progress bar
* Panel
* Weel

TODO:
* Nav
* Label
* List group
