'@talend/scripts-config-react-webpack': patch
---

* fix: do not generate both hashed and non hashed assets for fonts, images and svgs.
* fix: do not copy icons into app root folder
* chore: put assets config in common so app and umd configuration are aligned.

Note: path has been changed this way:

```diff
# case of woff in lib
- mylib/dist/[hash].woff
- mylib/dist/fonts/[name].woff
+ mylib/dist/assets/fonts/[name].woff

# case if woff in app
- myapp/dist/[hash].woff
- myapp/dist/fonts/[name].woff
+ myapp/dist/assets/fonts/[name]-[hash].woff

# case of img in lib

+ mylib/dist/assets/img/[name].woff

# case of img in app
- myapp/dist/[hash].png
