# Voice and Tone

Voice and tone arise from the relationship with users.
Connecting with users, building trust, and gaining users' loyalty are some of the results of adapting a specific voice and tone strategy. It's important for everyone who writes customer-facing copy to use consistent voice and tone.

## Voice

It reflects the personality of Talend apps, which is usually described in adjectives, for example:

- Friendly, approachable
- Easy, convenient
- Reliable
- Informative
- Professional
- Sympathetic
- Secure
- Innovative
- Succint
- Welcoming

What type of character speaks to your customers through the UI? What spokesperson brings our products to life and communicates what makes Talend special.

## Tone

It is how the voice changes in different situations: emotional dimensions of voice. It's how the content “speaks” in slightly different ways depending on the audience, specific points in user journey, or subject matter, just like people do.

How do we sound to our customers?
If Talend were a person, how would you describe them?
