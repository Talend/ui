# Search

Input elements of type search are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into.
These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently by the user agent.

<Use>
	<Use.Do>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use "Search XXX" when users are supposed to search somewhere globally. It's more about
				"where" users will be searching (e.g., Search projects, Search environments).
			</li>
			<li>
				Use "Find a/an XXX" when users are supposed to find something in a page or a list. It's more
				about the object they want to find (e.g., Find a pipeline, Find a semnatic type).
