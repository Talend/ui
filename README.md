# UI

That repository was created in an effort to simplify the development of Talend's front-end stack.

## Goals

- Single code repository / Multiple packages
- Global (cross package) test and review tools
- Unified stack versions
- Easy cross packages development

## The stack

- [react-cmf](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/cmf)
- [react-talend-containers](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/containers)
- [react-talend-components](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/components)
- [react-talend-forms](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/forms)
- [generator-talend](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/generator)
- [talend-icons](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/icons)
- [bootstrap-talend-theme](https://github.com/Talend/ui/tree/master/packages/theme)
