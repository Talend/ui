CMF stands for Content Management Framework. It helps you to build an application in React with a system to configure your contents and much more.

It combines
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to manage app state
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to manage your routes

Based on a `component / action creator` registry and a `settings` format, you configure your entire app
* the routes
* which component to load on a route
* which props to pass to this component to load
* which action is dispatched

## The core concepts
* [Store]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-28-core-store.md %}) : CMF is coupled to `redux` to manage your app state with internal CMF state
* [Registry]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-28-core-registry.md %}) : CMF has a registry where you can set `components` and `action creators`
* [Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-28-core-settings.md %}) : this is used to configure your app content, customising the `routes` (url, components), `views` and static `actions`.

## How CMF works

*Registry*
* Register your `components` with unique names.
* Register your `action creators` with unique names.

*Settings*
* Settings > routes map `urls` to registered `components` names and `views` settings names.
* Settings > views contains the `components` props and can refer to `actions` settings names.
* Settings > actions contains either static actions definition or can refer to registered `action creators` names.

*Bootstrap and runtime*

* Bootstrap your app with the provided `<App />` component
* CMF instantiates the right component on a requested route, injecting the props
