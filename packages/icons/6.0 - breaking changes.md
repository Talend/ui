# 6.0 Breaking changes

Icons package exports 2 modules:

- `@talend/icons/dist/react.js`: icons in react components format
- `@talend/icons/dist/info.js`: utility info to get icons from split bundles

They are now exported in a common index

```diff
-import talendIcons from '@talend/icons/dist/react';
-import talendIconsInfos from '@talend/icons/dist/info';
+import { react as talendIcons, info as talendIconsInfos } from '@talend/icons';
```
