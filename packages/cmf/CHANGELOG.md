### Major Changes

- 593026b37: Redux major upgrade with saga

* upgrade redux and redux-saga dependencies
* pass cmfConnect Container has a function using new style context
* update all cmf tests
* add forwardRef support
* add API to make tests easier to migrate
* update all sagas and tests according to the breaking changes
* update storybook cmf plugin
* add useCMFContext hook to return get the context with store and registry as before (for compatibility purpose of business code)
* rewrite List container as a function (needed to have full context)
* rewrite Notification container as function

So yes you can t use multiple contextTypes as for now. So all components using this must be re written as function and can use useCMFContext to access a context object.

**Breaking changes**

- update the package.json to align dependencies

  - up redux-saga: from 0.x to 1.x
  - up react-redux: from 5.x to 7.x
  - add "@redux-saga/testing-utils": "^1.1.3", for testing sagas purpose
  - up redux-batched-actions: from 0.2.0 to 0.5.0

- `yarn list --pattern redux` output is flat
- `yarn test command` is ok else fix them
- changeset has been added with major release on concerned packages
- peer dependencies are aligned with dev dependencies
- publish release on verdaccio is working

Tests

Most of tests of containers need to be updated. We have used the cmf mock to add a new API.
It works also with shallow if you have provided a context, please use `getEnzymeOption`.

```diff
-mount(<Container acks={Map()} />, { context: { registry } });
+mount(<Container acks={Map()} />, mock.Provider.getEnzymeOption({ registry }));
```

Saga setup import for test has changed

```diff
-import { createMockTask } from 'redux-saga/utils';
+import { createMockTask } from '@redux-saga/testing-utils';
```

Saga returns values has changed, it was result.value[TYPE].attr, it is now result.value.payload.attr and result.value.type

```diff
const result = generator.next();
-expect(result.value.FORK.args[1]).toEqual({
+expect(result.value.payload.args[1]).toEqual({
```

Saga delay import has moved from root to effect

```diff
-import { delay } from 'redux-saga';
+import { delay } from 'redux-saga/effects';
```

**react-bootstrap cmfConnected**

if you are in the case where react-bootstrap has been cmfConnect, please consider this fix:

```diff
import * as bootstrap from 'react-bootstrap';

const components = Object.keys(bootstrap).reduce((acc, key) => {
        if (!acc[key] && typeof bootstrap[key] === 'function') {
                const options = {};
+               if (key === 'DropdownButton') {
+                       options.forwardRef = true;
+               }
                if (!bootstrap[key].displayName) {
                        bootstrap[key].displayName = key;
                }
```

The change is cmfConnected components are now pure function and from the [doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#accessing-refs):
**You may not use the `ref` attribute on function components** because they donâ€™t have instances.
