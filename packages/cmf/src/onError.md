# onError

Error handling is a sensible topic and it is so important.
When an issue happens in an app and it has not been caught we need a lots of information to be able to understand it and debug it.

## User experience

What facebook says:

```
it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it
```

source: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#new-behavior-for-uncaught-errors

So we must inform the end user and give few options.

Without an available backend to post it we propose the following options to the user:

* `refresh` to reload the app
* `download report` to get the complete context when the error happens

With a backend available we post the information automaticly to it and let the user choose between

* `refresh` to reload the app
* `contact the support` with a given `id`

As a companie you must aggregate thoses errors and be notified from it.
An error for a end user means frustration so they should be treat as soon as possible.

But where react deleguate the handler error we will give a solution: notify the user and try to report it automaticly.

## Technical point of view

Before continue, please be sure you have read and understood the following documentation

* [Error Handling in React 16](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html)
* [Global Event Handlers onerror](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onerror)
* [online and offline events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/Online_and_offline_events)

When an error occured during rendering we fallback on an `ErrorFeedback` component. The worse situation may happens if this component fall in error.

When an error occured we dispatch an action.

## API

To setup onError please refer to the [bootstrap documentation](./bootstrap.md#onError)

CMF will post to the backend the following data structure:

| attribute | example value | description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `time` | "2018-11-16T09:51:44.500Z" | the current date time |
| `browser` | "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.102 Safari/537.36" | navigator.userAgent |
| `location` | https://www.myapp.com/path/#/hash | the location.href |
| `error` | { message, name , stack } | the fields we have found in the error |
| `uiState` | quite big object | the redux store |
| `actions` | [ { type: 'REDUX_TYPE', payload }] | last actions |

## Anonymisation / remove sensible data

In the process of the report all data are anonymise if the `key` lowercase name match one of the following rules.

* starts with $
* starts with _
* contains password
* contains secret
* contains key
* contains mail

In that case the content is transformed as a random string of the same length

[bootstrap API](./bootstrap.md#onError) let you add some other regex to match sensible keys if the previous rules are not enought in your project
