Quick start:

import components from './components';
import sagas from './sagas';

configure.initialize();
cmf.bootstrap({
	components,
	saga: sagas.appSaga, // function* appSaga() {...}
	...manyMoreOptions
});
```

## Modules

You apps may be splitted into different modules, like a core set of components and some other business logics.

For that CMF expose an API to let you merge your settings:

```javascript
import cmf from '@talend/react-cmf';

import containersModule from '@talend/react-containers';
import components from './components';
import saga from './saga';
import sagas from './sagas';

cmf.boostrap({
	components,
	saga,
	sagas,
	modules: [containersModule],
});
```
