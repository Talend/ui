## Architecture

[**_InputDateTimePicker_**](./InputDateTimePicker/InputDateTimePicker.md) is the full component usable in apps as is. It integrates the main picker in a dropdown and sycnhronize users actions between it and the input.

[**_DateTimePicker_**](./DateTimePicker/DateTimePicker.md) is the main picker component which rely on two views in the **_views_** folder :
- **_DateTimeView_** for picking :
    - the final date (by choosing a day on a specific month calendar)
    - the time
- **_MonthYearView_** for picking :
    - the month
    - the year

 _/!\ Month and year pickers are used to defined what month calendar is displayed on the **_DateTimeView_** view, not to define directly the final date /!\\_

Each view displays the picker units (month, year, date, time, etc.) needed, findable in the **_pickers_** folder.

All code fragments used accross multiples folders are stored in the **_shared_** folder.
