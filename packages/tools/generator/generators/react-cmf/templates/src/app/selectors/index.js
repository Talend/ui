/**
 * Selectors are function which take the state as first params and return
 * a portions of the state.
 * In used they are called on each state mutation, so really often.
 * Please take care of cache the results if the portion of the store you taken
 * hasn't changed. If you do so your component will not re-render.
 * If you don t do cache on selectors to keep reference you will have performance issues.
