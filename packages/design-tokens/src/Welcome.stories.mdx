# Design tokens

Design tokens are the single source of truth to name and store a design decision, distributed so teams can use it across design tools and coding languages.
They are exported from Figma using [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/).

Our tokens are documented within [Coral, our Design System.](https://design.talend.com)
