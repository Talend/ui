Tabs are used for switching between different views, functional aspects or categorized data sets.

### Variations

#### Sizes

	alt="image for tabs"
/>

As you have seen above, Tabs can exist in regular ("M") or Large ("L") sizes.

Only use the large size when tabs act as a second level of navigation on page-wide basis. Do not use in nested elements (drawers, modals etc...).

#### Tabs with icons

<FigmaImage

	alt="image for tabs with icons"
/>

Icons can be used with tabs to help users differentiate among them. Tabs with icons has the same behaviours.

	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithIcon} />

#### Tabs with tags

Labels can be used with tabs to indicate the number of items inside a category. Please refer to the labels guideline for more information.

The default max value of an item is 999. When the value to display is greater than 999, display a + after.

Mouse over the label will display the exact number item.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithTag} />
</Canvas>

## States

**Super long item names are truncated.**

Please display a tooltip on hover that contains the full name.

Max width item: 22rem (token: $coral-sizing-xxl).

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithLongTitles} />
</Canvas>

## Content

The word/words on tabs should be accurate, specific, and explicit to help users smoothly switching to the right view or functional aspect. A good tab label should clearly describe the content contained within it.

<Use>
	<Use.Do>
		<ul>
			<li>Use sentence case in tab labels.</li>
			<li>Use labels which clearly describe the content behind the tab.</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Do>
	<Use.Dont>
		<ul>
			<li>Donâ€™t use more than 3 words on a tab: keep it short and simple.</li>
			<li>Don't use title case or all caps in tab labels (except for acronyms).</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Dont>
</Use>

## Usage

### API vs Composition

Tabs can be used either as a standalone block component, or split into two parts: a list of tab buttons and, somewhere else (nearby) the contents.

To accommodate these two options, we provide two ways to implement Tabs in your project.

#### API

This is the standard, most straightforward way to use Tabs.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabStandalone} />
</Canvas>

It also works for large Tabs if needed:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={Stories.TabStandaloneLarge} />
</Canvas>

#### Composition

This is the "I know what I am doing" mode. It lets you build the Tabs through composition, thus letting you split the Tabs list and the Tab panels.

This is also the implementation that is most likely to break. Use only when necessary!

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithComposition} />
</Canvas>

This method supports the same features as the API one:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithCompositionLarge} />
</Canvas>

### Default tab mode

You may need to set a default opened tab from the outside. You can:

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabStandaloneControlled} />
</Canvas>

or in composition mode:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={Stories.TabsWithCompositionControlled} />
</Canvas>

### Use Tabs as router links

You may need something that looks like tabs but is actually a navigation pattern.

For this we have a dedicated component that gives you a list of links and make them look like tabs:

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TabsAsLinks} />
</Canvas>
