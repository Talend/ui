# About Icons

To date, Coral provides two `Icon` components. A legacy one and a new one. Eventually, the newer one will remain, alone.

**Why two components?**

- The original one was built around a philosophy of "everything goes". It's a component library approach.

- The newer one does not follow the same principles. It enforces a strict ruleset that is the same for designers and for developers.

The original `Icon` component can take any size we want, support any color etc... Whereas the newer `SizedIcon` does not.

## SizedIcon (use this)

Icons are now strictly defined by size.

`SizedIcon` takes two props `size` and `name`. The available `name`s will be dependent on the chosen `size`!

[Checkout the SizedIcon docs here.](/docs/components-icon-sizedicon--icon-xs)

<Canvas>
	<Story name="SizedIconExample">
		<StackHorizontal gap="XS">
			<SizedIcon size="S" name="note-pencil" />
			<SizedIcon size="M" name="note-pencil" />
			<SizedIcon size="L" name="note-pencil" />
		</StackHorizontal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

Calling `<SizedIcon size="XS" name="note-pencil" />` would not compile in TS because `note-pencil` does not exist at this size.

This is true both for developers and designers.

## Icon (deprecated)

Because a Big Bang Change is not possible, we have chosen to keep the legacy `Icon` component alive. For now.

[Checkout the Icon docs here.](/docs/components-icon-icon-legacy--page)

<Canvas>
	<Story name="IconExample">
		<StackHorizontal gap="XS">
			<Icon name="talend-cross" style={{ width: '1.2rem', height: '1.2rem' }} />
			<Icon name="talend-cross" />
			<Icon name="talend-cross" style={{ width: '2.4rem', height: '2.4rem' }} />
		</StackHorizontal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

These icons are lawless. Some even have their own colorset. They are impossible to homogenize as part of a design language.
