# About Form components

The Design System provides a collection of elements built for web forms.

## Fields

The library provides a collection of fields, mostly applying our design language to HTML standard elements.

We do however extend standard fields with prefix and affix support, error management and built-in labels.

## Layout elements

### The `Form` component

A very `low-opinion` component, `Form` can easily be replaced by the html `form` element with the attributes of your choice.

Using `Form` will grant you a ready-made flex layout with a `spacing-s` gap for your fields.

[Browse the Form documentation for examples.](/docs/components-form-form--form-skeleton)

### The `Fieldset` component

Neatly wrap together your fields with the `Fieldset` component.

It provides an enforced gap between children fields but can also sport a `legend` prop for better contextualization.

[Browse the Fieldset documentation for examples.](/docs/components-form-form-fieldset--default-story)

### The `Row` component

Used to wrap fields that must stand next to one another.

By default, the fields will only take the space that they need to:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={AboutRowsDefault} />
</Canvas>

If necessary, `Row` can stretch to fill the form's width:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={AboutRowsStretch} />
</Canvas>

In both cases, a gap of `spacing-l` is enforced between the fields.

### The `Buttons` component

An opinionated layout component, `Button`'s mission is to enforce the placement of the form's actions.
