# Button as links

Despite your complete reliance on best practices, you may be forced into situations that require a button that is actually a link.

Their abilities are the same as the [Button component](/docs/components-clickable-buttons-button--variations) with exceptions:

- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be in the "loading" state
- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be in the "disabled" state
- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be used for dropdowns

## Zoning

	alt="zoning image for buttons as links"
/>

## Style

The style requirements are the same as `Button`'s with the exceptions of the unnecessary states.

They are otherwise available in the same sizes and with the same iconset.

### Variations

<Canvas withSource="closed">
	<Story story={Stories.Variations} />
</Canvas>

#### ButtonPrimaryAsLink

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.PrimaryAsLink} name="ButtonPrimary as link" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonPrimary as link" />

#### ButtonDestructiveAsLink

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.DestructiveAsLink} name="ButtonDestructive as link" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonDestructive as link" />

#### ButtonSecondaryAsLink

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.SecondaryAsLink} name="ButtonSecondary as link" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonSecondary as link" />

#### ButtonTertiaryAsLink

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TertiaryAsLink} name="ButtonTertiary as link" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonTertiary as link" />

#### ButtonAsLink

If you need to switch from one variant to another, using a prop can be easier than importing multiple components.

`ButtonAsLink` is a standalone component made just for that.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.VariantComponent} name="ButtonAsLink with variant prop" />
</Canvas>

## States

N/A

## Interactions

Being links, `ButtonAsLink` components can be hovered and active, but they cannot be disabled.

The loading state has been removed as well.

### Button skeletons

Use the Skeletons for `Button`.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={ButtonStories.SkeletonButton} />
	<Story story={ButtonStories.SkeletonButtonSmall} />
	<Story story={ButtonStories.SkeletonButtonIcon} />
</Canvas>

### Button tooltips

ButtonsAsLinks can also have a tooltip on hover displaying additional description.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.TooltipButton} />
</Canvas>

## Content

The rules of `Button` apply here as well. You'll [find them here](/docs/components-clickable-buttons-button--variations#content).

## Usage

Links in React SPAs are often handled through React Router and similar packages.

Each `ButtonAsLink` is therefore able to shape itself around them, here React Router's `<Link />` for instance:

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.ButtonAsRouterLink} name="ButtonPrimary as Router link" />
</Canvas>

The usual `ButtonAsLink` collection component also enables the same behaviour, if you prefer props to standalone variants.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.ButtonAsRouterLinkVariant} name="ButtonAsLink" />
</Canvas>
