# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are navigation elements providing comprehensive context to users.

It helps them locate the current page within a larger workflow.

## Zoning

## Style

<FigmaImage

	alt="Breadcrumb in various states"
/>
<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

### Variations

Breadcrumbs cannot display more than 4 items without collapsing the "crumbs" somewhat. Here's how it behaves above 4 links.

<Canvas>
	<Story height="15rem" story={Stories.Advanced} />
</Canvas>

## States

### Overflow

The individual items of a `Breadcrumbs` component have a max-width of 320px.

If they do not have enough space to spread that wide, the text-overflow sets in as needed:

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.FullWidth} />
</Canvas>

## Interactions

## Usage

### With Router Links

`Breadcrumb` uses `Link` components in the background. You can use a subset of `Link`'s props, including `as`.

This enables third-party router links to be used in a breadcrumb.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Usage} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Breadcrumbs have:

- `aria-label="breadcrumb"` on their outer `nav` DOM element
- `aria-current="page"` on the last link it shows
- The button triggering the dropdown for collapsed links has screen-ready specific text: `Display collapsed links`
- The dropdown with the collapsed links has `aria-label="Collapsed links"`
