# ButtonIcon

This component should be used when icons are meant to be clicked on.

It handles the two largest usecases we have for clickable icons: actions and toggles.

- Always try use when an icon is meant to be clicked on.
- Always provide developers with copy for the tooltip.
- If the button holds the ON / OFF state of something, then use the Toggle variants.
- If the button is floating on top of something else, use the Floating variant.
- Only use size XS sporadically.
- Spacing between buttons should be at least 4px (XXS), 8px is best (XS).

#### Default

This is the go-to ButtonIcon for most generic actions.

#### Toggle

If the button needs to hold an active / inactive state, then it is a Toggle.

Donâ€™t use Toggles in series, opt for badge dropdowns instead.

#### Floating

This variant is only used when the button floats on top of content.

## States

Like all buttons, ButtonIcon can be hovered, active, disabled or focused. See "Interaction" for details.

It also can display a "loading" state for asynchronous actions.

### Loading

Only use when necessary to avoid multiple clicks when the action is not instant.

### Skeleton

Skeleton needs are handled by the Skeleton component.

// TODO

## Interaction

## Content

All ButtonIcons carry a tooltip on hover. The content of that tooltip should be a short ("do something") and effective.
