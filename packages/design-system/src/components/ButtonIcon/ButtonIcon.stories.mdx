# ButtonIcon

This component should be used when icons are meant to be clicked on.

It handles the two largest usecases we have for clickable icons: actions and toggles.

- Always try use when an icon is meant to be clicked on.
- Always provide developers with copy for the tooltip.
- If the button holds the ON / OFF state of something, then use the Toggle variants.
- If the button is floating on top of something else, use the Floating variant.
- Only use size XS when absolutely unavoidable.
- Spacing between buttons should be at least 4px (XXS), 8px is best (XS).

<Canvas withSource="closed">

</Canvas>

#### Default

This is the go-to ButtonIcon for most generic actions.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.DefaultButtonIcon} name="ButtonIcon" />
</Canvas>

#### Toggle

If the button needs to hold an active / inactive state, then it is a Toggle.

Don’t use Toggles in series, opt for badge dropdowns instead.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.DefaultButtonIconToggle} name="ButtonIconToggle" />
</Canvas>

#### Floating

This variant is only used when the button floats on top of content.

It could be it's sitting on top of a line connecting two nodes, or sticky on top of a draggable scene for instance.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.DefaultButtonIconFloating} name="ButtonIconFloating" />
</Canvas>

## States

ButtonIcons can display a "loading" state for asynchronous actions.

### Loading

Only use when necessary to avoid multiple clicks when the action is not instant.

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Loading} />
</Canvas>

### Skeleton

Skeleton needs are handled by the Skeleton component.

// TODO

## Interaction

All buttons have interactive states for "hover", "active" and "disabled". A focus ring should also be displayed on keyboard navigation.

## Content

All ButtonIcons carry a tooltip on hover. The content of that tooltip should be short ("do something") and effective.

## Usage

You have access to three components with curated props for each.

### ButtonIcon

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Default} name="ButtonIcon usage" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonIcon usage" />

### ButtonIconToggle

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Toggle} name="ButtonIconToggle usage" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonIconToggle usage" />

### ButtonIconFloating

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Floating} name="ButtonIconFloating usage" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="ButtonIconFloating usage" />

### Button props

Of course all buttons can also use natural `<button>` attributes (but not `classNames` nor `style`).

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.NaturalButtonProps} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

In order to be semantically correct, `ButtonIconToggle`'s active state is dependent on the `aria-pressed` attribute being set to `true`.

This attribute is transparent to consumers of the component and providing the mandatory `isActive` prop will actually assign the correct `aria-pressed` value.
