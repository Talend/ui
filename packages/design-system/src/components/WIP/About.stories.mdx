# About WIP components

These components are not quite ready for prime-time yet. We have chosen to document them in this storybook for various purposes:

- Maybe they are needed quickly but can't be considered mature yet.
- Maybe they need more design but having what's been done documented makes sense.
- Maybe they need more engineering but doing it all in one go would be too much.

Either way we've opted to give them their own place to hang out.

Each page starts with a quick message explaining what to expect. When a WIP component should not be used, it will be clearly stated.
