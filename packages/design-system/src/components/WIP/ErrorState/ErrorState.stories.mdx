# ErrorState

Definition

They describe the state where the app fails to complete an action or can't respond or do what the user wants.

The scope of the error varies and could be associated with:

- The entire app
- The entire current screen
- A specific element on the screen

Depending on the scope, the error state may display directly on the screen, in dialogs, or in toasters.

### Usage

Use this error state to clearly tell users what went wrong, the underlying cause and how they could fix the problem, take a step back, or move to other pages.

This error state includes:

- an icon which supports the error message (except in alert toasters)
- an informative title to clearly state the problem
- body text to:
  - Say why this happened and give any additional information or context users need to know in order to do the right action. Avoid repeating content from the title
    - suggest actions users can take
    - give users at least one button (primary CTA) to help them resolve the problem and a secondary outline button, a button with an option to go back and cancel the action. (except in alert toasters)
