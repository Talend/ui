# EmptyState

They describe the “empty” screens in an application when a system does not have anything to show.

Use empty states to communicate about the current state of the system or to tell users what they can do next to get started.

## Style

### Purposes

Two goals are identified:

- **Informative empty states**: No data is shown yet because there are things to be done first, but with no direct action from the user.
- **Actionable empty states**:
  - No data is shown yet because there is an action the user must take first
  - No data is shown because the system can't find any results, ex. filter or search results

### Variations

**Spot illustration (AKA Spot)**

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Spot} />
</Canvas>

**Icon illustration (AKA Icon)**

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Icon} />
</Canvas>
