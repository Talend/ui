# EmptyState

They describe the “empty” screens in an application when a system does not have anything to show.

Use empty states to communicate about the current state of the system or to tell users what they can do next to get started.

## Style

### Purposes

Two goals are identified:

- **Informative empty states**: No data is shown yet because there are things to be done first, but with no direct action from the user.
- **Actionable empty states**:
  - No data is shown yet because there is an action the user must take first
  - No data is shown because the system can't find any results, ex. filter or search results

### Variations

Empty states come in different sizes to accommodate to empty state types and page layout.

#### EmptyStateLarge (with Spot illustration)

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Large} />
</Canvas>

**Content guidelines**

Use large empty states when the empty content area on screen takes up at least 50% of the view.

- Use a spot illustration which supports your empty state message
- Include an informative title
- Use body text to: 
  - (Informative empty states) tell users what will display here, with no direct actions from them 
  - (Actionable empty states) guide users towards taking the next step when there's an action they can take
- (Only actionable empty states) Give a call-to-action (CTA) button when users can resolve the empty state
- (Optional but preferred) Include a "Learn more" link to the documentation if the feature is documented

#### EmptyStateMedium (with Icon illustration)

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Medium} />
</Canvas>

**Content guidelines**

Use medium empty states when the empty content area on screen takes up less than 50% of the view.

- Use an icon which supports your empty state message
- Include an informative title
- Use body text to: 
  - (Informative empty states) tell users what will display here, with no direct actions from them 
  - (Actionable empty states) guide users towards taking the next step when there's an action the user can take
- (Optional but preferred) Include a "Learn more" link to the documentation if the feature is documented

#### EmptyStateSmall (with no Icon illustration)

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.Small} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

### Button as Link

You may need your callback to redirect to a page. The `callback` props is tailored to mimic either `ButtonPrimary` or `ButtonPrimaryAsLink`.

You can therefore easily set-up a callback that's actually a link:

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.LargeWithLinkButton} />
</Canvas>
