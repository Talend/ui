# Message

Message is a component that displays some information to the user and provide actions to interact with it.

## Zoning

TODO : FIGMA TO LINK

## Style

### Text

The text should adapt to the surrounding layout. Depending on the context, if the text is too long it should automatically wrap to the next line.
It's still advise to keep the text short and concise.

### Variations

**Default**

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.DefaultMessageDemo} />
</Canvas>

**With optional props**

<Canvas>
	<Story story={Stories.WithPropVariation} />
</Canvas>

## Interactions

The message can have :

- A link to go to the documentation or a specific page
- A button linked to the message to allow the user to go further in the message resolution

## Content

Title:

<ul>
	<li>The title should contains 2 to 3 word maximum</li>
	<li>
		Ideally it should stay in 1 line. Users must be able to zoom in a lot on the text size without
		losing content, so the title should be able to reflow nearly at will.
	</li>
	<li>Title is a short description of the content (error, warning, info …)</li>
</ul>

Text:

<ul>
	<li>The content should be display on maximum 5 lines</li>
	<li>
		Content is a short description of the event which have occured on the page (error, warning, info
		…)
	</li>
	<li>It should explain briefly the type of error/info etc. contained in the collection</li>
</ul>

Main action :

<ul>
	<li>Main action possible could be "see/select"</li>
	<li>Main action can also be "delete/dismiss/apply" relying on the context</li>
</ul>

<Use>
	<Use.Do>
		<ul>
			<li>Titles should be kept short, but to be accessible we understand they can reflow.</li>
			<li>Description text should also be kept short, but should also reflow at will.</li>
			<li>Only one dock link per message.</li>
			<li>Only one main action per message.</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Do>
