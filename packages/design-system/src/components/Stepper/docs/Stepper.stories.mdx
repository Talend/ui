# Stepper

Stepper is used to display the different steps to take to complete an action.

It helps users avoid frustration and successfully complete a primary task.

The stepper displays progress through a sequence split into multiple logical and numbered steps.

## Style

### Variations

A Stepper is **vertical by default** but can be horizontal.

**Vertical**

Consider using a vertical stepper when there are workflows greater than 3 steps.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Vertical">
		<Stepper>
			<Stepper.Step.Validated title="Lorem ipsum" />
			<Stepper.Step.InProgress title="Lorem ipsum" />
			<Stepper.Step.Enabled title="Enabled state" />
			<Stepper.Step.Enabled title="Enabled state" />
		</Stepper>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

**Horizontal**

Consider using a horizontal stepper when full page components are used (such as Data grid or List)

A horizontal stepper cannot have more than 3 steps.

The sub-steps option is not available with the horizontal stepper.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Horizontal">
		<Stepper.Horizontal>
			<Stepper.Step.Validated>Lorem ipsum</Stepper.Step.Validated>
			<Stepper.Step.InProgress>Lorem ipsum</Stepper.Step.InProgress>
			<Stepper.Step.Enabled>Enabled state</Stepper.Step.Enabled>
		</Stepper.Horizontal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## States

**Vertical**

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Loading vertical">
		<Stepper.Vertical>
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
		</Stepper.Vertical>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

**Horizontal**

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Loading horizontal">
		<Stepper.Horizontal>
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
			<Stepper.Step.Skeleton />
		</Stepper.Horizontal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Content

Use action phrases, two-word labels, for steps.
Start with a verb and follow it with a noun.
Step labels should describe the purpose of the step to keep users informed about what does each step do.
Use a longer version of the step label in the title of the step section to provide some more info and make the step clearer.
For example, the step label could be "Add engine", while the section title could be "Add the engine on which to process data"
Step sections could also have subtitles if necessary to provide users with extra important information—mostly used for complicated steps.
Under the step section, use clear labels for all user input.

<Use>
	<Use.Do>
		<ul>
			<li>Keep step labels concise; use only two words if possible (verb + noun)</li>
			<li>Use action phrases consistently through steps</li>
			<li>Use step labels which logically sync with the title of the page they link to</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Do>
	<Use.Dont>
		<ul>
			<li>Use complex long words</li>
			<li>Mix action and noun phrases in steps labels</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Dont>
</Use>

### Buttons

In case of multi-step form, we should always have at least 2 buttons:

1. Cancel or Back button
2. Continue or Next button

Use a **cancel button** for the first step as the user can't step back. Use a **back button** from the second step to allow the user to step back.

<FigmaImage
	src="https://www.figma.com/file/WUVKJmcDHfR7K1q1lYhaHk/Stepper?node-id=115%3A0"
	alt="buttons mutli step form example"
/>

The back button can also be used in addition of the cancel button. In that case, the button order is the following one:

<FigmaImage
	src="https://www.figma.com/file/WUVKJmcDHfR7K1q1lYhaHk/Stepper?node-id=408%3A5876"
	alt="cancel and back buttons for multi step form"
/>

## Interactions

**Error**

In case of an error in the current step, please inform the user by using an inline message. Do not disable the next button.

## Usage

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="usage"
		args={{
			variant: 'Vertical',
		}}
		argTypes={{
			variant: {
				description: 'Stepper variation',
				control: {
					type: 'select',
					options: ['Vertical', 'Horizontal'],
				},
			},
		}}
	>
		{({ variant, index, title }) => {
			const StepperComponent = Stepper[variant];
			StepperComponent.displayName = `Stepper.${variant}`;
			return (
				<StepperComponent>
					<Stepper.Step.Validated title="Validated" />
					<Stepper.Step.InProgress title="In progress" />
					<Stepper.Step.Enabled title="Enabled" />
				</StepperComponent>
			);
		}}
	</Story>
