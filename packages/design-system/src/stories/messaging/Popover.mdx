# Popover

Popover displays floating informative and actionable content in relation to its disclosure.

## Zoning

## Style

### Default

<Canvas>
	<Story height="12rem" story={Stories.DefaultStory} />
</Canvas>

### Disable padding in popover contents

<Canvas>
	<Story height="12rem" story={Stories.WithoutPaddingStory} />
</Canvas>

### Disclosure

You can use any of the design system's "Clickable" or "Form" component as a disclosure.

<Canvas>
	<Story height="12rem" story={Stories.DisclosureStory} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
	<Story height="15rem" story={Stories.FormDisclosureStory} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

### Close popover from the inside

You may need to programmatically close the popover with an interaction from its content.

Such would be the case when submitting a setting or simply clicking on a "close" button.

You can do just so by using the "function as children" pattern:

<Canvas>
	<Story height="12rem" story={Stories.WithFunctionAsChildren} />
</Canvas>

As you can see, the button inside that popover consumes the popover's state and its methods.
