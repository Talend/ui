# Modal

A modal serves as a root component for all varieties of dialog (confirm ...).

/>

## Style

### Sizing

The modal should adapt to the content:

- Width can vary between a minimum 660px up to 95% of the screen's width
- Height can expand up to 80% of the screen's height

### Header

It can feature a description and / or an icon.

Header icon: Either a 24x24 icon from the library OR a provided logo.
For devs this means either an IconName or a ReactElement.
Enforce the 24x24 sizing if it’s an element.

Title and description: Both have an ellipsis if there isn’t enough space, the text will not wrap.

### Content

Overflow should be vertically scrollable when needed, but horizontally hidden.
Scroll is limited to the content section (header and footer remain fixed).

### Buttons

Close button: Should say “cancel” when there are actions on the right, a “close” when there are none.
Actions: Up to two, one primary, one secondary. Ideally can’t have a secondary if there’s no primary.
Destructive: The primary action can be destructive.

### Backdrop

Transparent layer behind every modal. Clicking it closes the modal by default, but this behavior can be disabled by a prop.
