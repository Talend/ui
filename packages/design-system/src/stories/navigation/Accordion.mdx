# Accordion

Accordion is used to display expandable/collapsable cards with a title.

## Collapsible panel

<Canvas of={Stories.SimpleCollapsiblePanel} />

## Collapsible panel with status

<Canvas of={Stories.StatusCollapsiblePanel} />

## Variations

**Disabled**

A disabled panel will hide its chevron and action, will not be clickable and will display its title in `neutral-text-disabled`.

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledPanel} />

**Small size**

Use the prop `size` to change the height, font size and icon size of the panel header.

(currently there is only <b>M</b>(default) and <b>S</b> supported)

<Canvas of={Stories.SmallPanel} />

**With action**

The prop `action` takes an object with 3 attributes :

- <b>icon</b>: a string containing a talend icon id
- <b>title</b>: the content of the tooltip displayed on mouseOver
- <b>callback</b>: a function called when the action is triggered

<Canvas of={Stories.WithAction} />

**With metadata**

The prop `metadata` takes an array of ReactElement or String, and displays them between the panel title and action.

A vertical divider is inserted between each metadata.

Using Accordions that way is discouraged.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithMetadata} />

## Accordion wrapper

You can wrap a group of panels with an <b>Accordion</b> component.

It will control the expand/collapse of each panel so that only one is open at the same time.

<Canvas of={Stories.AccordionWrapper} />

## group of panels

<Canvas of={Stories.GroupOfSimplePanels} />

## Accessibility

- Press <kbd>Tabs</kbd> to focus on the item controling each panel and/or the action

- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand/collapse the panel or call the action
