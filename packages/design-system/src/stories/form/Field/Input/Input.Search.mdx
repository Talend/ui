`Form.Search` is a text field designed for user queries. These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently by the browser.

## Content

The placeholder in the search field should read as either of the below texts depending on the context.

<Use>
	<Use.Do>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use "Search XXX" when users are supposed to search somewhere globally. It's more about
				"where" users will be searching (e.g., Search projects, Search environments).
			</li>
			<li>
				Use "Find a/an XXX" when users are supposed to find something in a page or a list. It's more
				about the object they want to find (e.g., Find a pipeline, Find a semantic type).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</Use.Do>
