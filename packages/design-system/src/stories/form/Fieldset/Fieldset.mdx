# Form Fieldset

Fieldsets group together fields within a form.

It's a semantic group, not necessarily a visual one. This component however provides a `legend` prop to help visually segment fieldsets.

## Zoning

/>

## Style

Group logical blocks into a fieldset.

If the fields are even more closely related, display them on the same line using `Row`.

## States

### Error

A fieldset usually does not carry error state. Its individual fields do.

	alt="Fieldset mockup with state"
/>

<Canvas>
	<Story of={Stories.Error} />
</Canvas>

In case of more than one error or a horizontal fieldset, display the errors under each affected field.

/>

<Canvas>
	<Story of={Stories.Errors} />
</Canvas>

## Content

### Legend

Provide a legend to the fieldset to help contextualize its contents.

### Inline message

Field validation may sometime be more complex than on a single field.

If the broken validation rule benefits from a single point of explanation, use an `InlineMessage` within the affected `Fieldset` instead.

This is the only exception to the rule. Errors must otherwise be displayed under each field.

## Interactions

### Conditional fieldsets

A conditional fieldset appears only when previous conditions are met.

The trigger can be any "on / off" interactions available in a form:

- A checkbox has been activated
- A radio button has been selected
- A switch has been toggled
- A select field has been set to a specific value
- A button has been pressed

Use sparingly as it makes a form harder to predict and understand at a glance.
