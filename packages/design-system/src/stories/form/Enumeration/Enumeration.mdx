# Enumeration

Lazy loading list that allows to create, edit and remove items from it.

## Variations

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

<Canvas of={Stories.Empty} />

## Usage

The component is split into two parts, the _header_ and the _body_.

### Header

The header has a `title` and the 3 different actions:

1. Create: `onCreate` - optional parameter.
2. Edit: Triggers edit mode on the body part of the component, which allows for items to be selected. When items are selected, a "Remove" button appears, which triggers the `onRemove` callback when clicked.
3. Import: `onImport` - optional parameter. If not passed, the action will not appear.

All actions (create, edit and remove) call the `onChange` callback.

The search feature only filters the items already rendered. Since its a lazy loading list, if the items are not rendered they will not be included on the search.

### Body

The part of the component where the lazy loading list is present from the `items` parameter. To load more items, the `loadMoreRows` callback must be passed to the component, with _startIndex_ and _stopIndex_ parameters.

```tsx
<Enumeration
	...
	loadMoreRows={({ startIndex, stopIndex }) => {
		...
	}}
/>
```

Each item can be editted or removed individually.
