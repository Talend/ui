# Button as links

Despite your complete reliance on best practices, you may be forced into situations that require a button that is actually a link.

Their abilities are the same as the [Button component](/docs/clickable-button--docs) with exceptions:

- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be in the "loading" state
- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be in the "disabled" state
- `ButtonAsLink` components can't be used for dropdowns

/>

## Style

The style requirements are the same as `Button`'s with the exceptions of the unnecessary states.

They are otherwise available in the same sizes and with the same iconset.

### Variations

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={Stories.Variations} />

#### ButtonPrimaryAsLink

<Canvas of={Stories.PrimaryAsLink} />
<Controls of={Stories.PrimaryAsLink} />

#### ButtonDestructiveAsLink

<Canvas of={Stories.DestructiveAsLink} />
<Controls of={Stories.DestructiveAsLink} />

#### ButtonSecondaryAsLink

<Canvas of={Stories.SecondaryAsLink} />
<Controls of={Stories.SecondaryAsLink} />

#### ButtonTertiaryAsLink

<Canvas of={Stories.TertiaryAsLink} />
<Controls of={Stories.TertiaryAsLink} />

#### ButtonAsLink

If you need to switch from one variant to another, using a prop can be easier than importing multiple components.

`ButtonAsLink` is a standalone component made just for that.

<Canvas of={Stories.VariantComponent} />

## States

N/A

## Interactions

Being links, `ButtonAsLink` components can be hovered and active, but they cannot be disabled.

The loading state has been removed as well.

### Button skeletons

Use the same Skeletons as `Button`.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.SkeletonButton} />

[The Skeleton Documentation is over there!](/docs/feedback-skeleton--docs)

### Button tooltips

ButtonsAsLinks can also have a tooltip on hover displaying additional description.

<Canvas of={Stories.TooltipButton} />

## Content

The rules of `Button` apply here as well. You'll [find them here](/docs/clickable-button--docs#content).

## Usage

Links in React SPAs are often handled through React Router and similar packages.

Each `ButtonAsLink` is therefore able to shape itself around them, here React Router's `<Link />` for instance:

<Canvas of={Stories.ButtonAsRouterLink} />

The usual `ButtonAsLink` collection component also enables the same behaviour, if you prefer props to standalone variants.

<Canvas of={Stories.ButtonAsRouterLinkVariant} />

## Accessibility
