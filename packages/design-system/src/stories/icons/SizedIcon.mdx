# SizedIcon

This component serves every icon in the new Figma [Icon Library](https://www.figma.com/file/L1QUr28Y79ydAv05nQVmaA/Icon-Library?node-id=2064%3A17133).

It follows the same ruleset: an icon is defined by its size first, its name second.

## Style

All of those icons are styles through `currentColor`: they will take on the color of the parent's `color` CSS attribute.

The expected tokens for icons are the `coral-color-[semantic]-text` or `coral-color-[semantic]-icon` ones.

You may need to wrap your icon with a `span` node to target it specifically.

## Usage

Icons are illustrative elements, not interactive. If you need a clickable icon, check out [the ButtonIcon docs here.](/docs/clickable-buttonicon--docs)

## Accessibility

Icons sport the `aria-hidden` attribute. As purely illustrative elements, they must not have contextual value.
