# About Icons

To date, Coral provides two `Icon` components. A legacy one and a new one. Eventually, the newer one will remain, alone.

**Why two components?**

- The original one was built around a philosophy of "everything goes". It's a component library approach.

- The newer one does not follow the same principles. It enforces a strict ruleset that is the same for designers and for developers.

The original `Icon` component can take any size we want, support any color etc... Whereas the newer `SizedIcon` does not.

## SizedIcon

Icons are now strictly defined by size.

`SizedIcon` takes two props `size` and `name`. The available `name`s will be dependent on the chosen `size`!

[Checkout the SizedIcon docs here.](/docs/icons-sizedicon--docs)

<Canvas>
	<Story of={SizedStories.Example} />
</Canvas>

<ArgTypes of={SizedStories.IconXS} />

Calling `<SizedIcon size="XS" name="note-pencil" />` would not compile in TS because `note-pencil` does not exist at this size.

This is true both for developers and designers.

## Icon (SVG / Remote . Img)

This is more generic component which is not considered as Icon but more as image&svg loader

<Canvas>
	<Story of={Stories.Usage} />
</Canvas>

These icons are lawless. Some even have their own colorset. They are impossible to homogenize as part of a design language.
