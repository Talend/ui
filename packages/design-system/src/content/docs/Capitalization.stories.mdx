# Capitalization

## Sentence case & title case

There are two common forms of capitalization—"Sentence case" and "Title Case". 

**In Talend the default is sentence case** where we capitalize only the first letter of the first word in a phrase. Use sentence case for titles and button labels.

## Capitalizing all letters (all caps)

Don't use uppercase—text with all the letters capitalized—in UI. All caps affect readability, comprehensions, and usability.
It is distracting to the user. It changes the tone of voice. Users process uppercase text slower.

Assume that everything is sentence case. Here are the exceptions:

- The word is a product name or a company name.
- The word is an acronym. Some acronyms have mixed case or lower case, but this is rare.
- The word is a Talend-specific common noun.

Reminder: not all technical terms are common nouns. A common mistake is to capitalize industry-specific terms like engine, server, database, etc. Unless the term is part of a product or is always capitalized in the industry, then do not capitalize.
