# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We use changeset to provide new version everyday with fixes, features and major release when we have a breaking change.
Let latest is the better. We also provide [talend-scripts upgrade:deps](./tools/upgrade-deps) scripts to make it easier to be aligned and updated.
The script comes with option about security use case so please read it first.

Distance to latest from npm is added on [dependencies.txt](./dependencies.txt) file on each upgrade PR.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue on github repository if you are outside Talend or in the companie tracker of your team if you are inside Talend.
You can then ask for help if you need to address the issue.
