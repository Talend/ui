# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We use `changeset` to provide versioning for our packages with fixes, features and major release in case of breaking changes. The latest package is always the better one.

We also provide [talend-scripts upgrade:deps](./tools/upgrade-deps) scripts to make it easier to keep our packages and apps aligned and updated.

The script comes with options about security use cases, so please read the documentation first.

Distance to latest from npm is added on [dependencies.txt](./dependencies.txt) file on each upgrade PR.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue on github repository if you are outside Talend or in the companie tracker of your team if you are inside Talend.
You can then ask for help if you need to address the issue.
