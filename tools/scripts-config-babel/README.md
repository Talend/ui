This package contains the main babel configuration used everywhere else in Talend.

## Babel config customisation

You can use your own babelrc but it is not recommanded. To do so, you will need to extend the preset babelrc.

```json
{
	"extends": "@talend/scripts-config-babel"
}
```

If you don't do so the app will fail in Error describe the above need.
Also please be sure to have read that file.
